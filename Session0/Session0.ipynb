    "Anaconda is the most widely used Python distribution. It comes with Python 3 and a whole lot of pre-loaded libraries and tools. It also handles all of the nasty dependencies between different packages and libraries for you, which makes it really useful especially as you get deeper into programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to install Anaconda: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the latest version for Python 3 from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once the download is finished, click on the executable and follow the installation steps. __Make sure to tick the box to add Anaconda to your PATH variable__, while the installer tels you this is a bad idea, it's actually crucial for being able to work with git effectively later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you've successfully installed Anaconda! :)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** You can check whether your installation was, indeed, successful by opening a command line window\\* and typing *which anaconda* (on MacOS and Linux) or *where anaconda* (on Windows) in the command prompt. This should show you the path to where your Anaconda distribution was installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\* You can access the command line on MacOS and Linux by simply typing *terminal* into the search field of your computer, and on Windows by searching for *cmd*. "

    "\n",
    "You can think of a Jupyter notebook as a notebook that both you and your computer can actually read. \n",
    "In a \"normal\" notebook, you would take (either hand-written or digital) notes, highlight and comment things, write paragraphs and equations, insert figures - but if you wrote a chunk of python code in your \"normal\" notebook, your computer wouldn't know how to execute any of it. You'd first have to turn the chunk of code into a format that your computer understands, maybe using a text editor such as Notepad++, or an IDE such as Pycharm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, in a \"normal\" python (.py) file, you can write executable computer code and comments, but as soon as you tried to insert a paragraph, bold font, a link, or maybe even a figure, the program would throw an error because it wouldn't know how to understand anything that isn't written in \"its\" programming language.\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks run via the **Jupyter Notebook App**, which allows you to edit and execute notebooks via your web browser. More specifically, the code in your notebook is executed via a **kernel**, which is basically a computational engine that does all of the actual computational work. Kernels exist for many languages (e.g., Python, R, Julia, NodeJS, C++, and many more). When you open an existing notebook, a kernel in the correct language for your notebook is automatically launched.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Note that kernels and notebooks are two separate things: If you close your web browser with the notebook in it, your kernel will still continue running (and possibly consume a lot of memory). So whenever you want to exit a notebook, make sure to also properly shut down your kernel (see 3.5). "

One really important new concept in Jupyter notebooks is that of a **Cell**. The little box you see beneath the menubars at the top - that's your first cell.
