    "Anaconda is the most widely used Python distribution. It comes with Python 3 and a whole lot of pre-loaded libraries and tools. It also handles all of the nasty dependencies between different packages and libraries for you, which makes it really useful especially as you get deeper into programming. \n",

    "Now that you've got Anaconda installed, we're ready to get started! We'll be using Jupyter notebooks throughout this entire course, because they offer a very easy and elegant way of interactively writing and sharing code, figures, equations, text and more in one single place. \n",

    "\n",
    "You can think of a Jupyter notebook as a notebook that both you and your computer can actually read. \n",
    "In a \"normal\" notebook, you would take (either hand-written or digital) notes, highlight and comment things, write paragraphs and equations, insert figures - but if you wrote a chunk of python code in your \"normal\" notebook, your computer wouldn't know how to execute any of it. You'd first have to turn the chunk of code into a format that your computer understands, maybe using a text editor such as Notepad++, or an IDE such as Pycharm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, in a \"normal\" python (.py) file, you can write executable computer code and comments, but as soon as you tried to insert a paragraph, bold font, a link, or maybe even a figure, the program would throw an error because it wouldn't know how to understand anything that isn't written in \"its\" programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook bridges this gap by allowing you to include both human-readable rich text (such as paragraphs, markup, links, equations, pictures, plots,...) and executable computer code. "

    "### 2.2 How does a Jupyter notebook run?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks run via the **Jupyter Notebook App**, which allows you to edit and execute notebooks via your web browser. More specifically, the code in your notebook is executed via a **kernel**, which is basically a computational engine that does all of the actual computational work. Kernels exist for many languages (e.g., Python, R, Julia, NodeJS, C++, and many more). When you open an existing notebook, a kernel in the correct language for your notebook is automatically launched.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Note that kernels and notebooks are two separate things: If you close your web browser with the notebook in it, your kernel will still continue running (and possibly consume a lot of memory). So whenever you want to exit a notebook, make sure to also properly shut down your kernel (see 2.x). "

One really important new concept in Jupyter notebooks is that of a **Cell**. The little box you see beneath the menubars at the top - that's your first cell.
